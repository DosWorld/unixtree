Curses Library Functions ecurs_scroll



NAME
     ecurs_scroll - scroll a curses window

SYNOPSIS
     #include <curses.h>

     int scroll(WINDOW *win);

     int scrl(int n);

     int wscrl(WINDOW *win, int n);

DESCRIPTION
     With the scroll() routine, the window is scrolled up one
     line. This involves moving the lines in the window data
     structure. As an optimization, if the scrolling region of
     the window is the entire screen, the physical screen is
     scrolled at the same time.

     With the scrl() and wscrl() routines, for positive n scroll
     the window up n lines (line i+n becomes i); otherwise scroll
     the window down n lines. This involves moving the lines in
     the window character image structure. The current cursor
     position is not changed.

     For these functions to work, scrolling must be enabled via
     scrollok().

RETURN VALUES
     All routines return the integer ERR upon failure and an
     integer value other than ERR upon successful completion.
