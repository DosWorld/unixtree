Curses Library Functions ecurs_insstr



NAME
     ecurs_insstr - insert string before character under the cursor
     in a curses window

SYNOPSIS
     #include <curses.h>

     int insstr(char *str);

     int insnstr(char *str, int n);

     int winsstr(WINDOW *win, char *str);

     int winsnstr(WINDOW *win, char *str, int n);

     int mvinsstr(int y, int x, char *str);

     int mvinsnstr(int y, int x, char *str, int n);

     int mvwinsstr(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, char *str);

     int mvwinsnstr(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, char *str, int n);

DESCRIPTION
     With these routines, a character string (as many characters
     as will fit on the line) is inserted before the character
     under the cursor. All characters to the right of the cursor
     are moved to the right, with the possibility of the
     rightmost characters on the line being lost. The cursor
     position does not change (after moving to y, x, if
     specified). (This does not imply use of the hardware insert
     character feature.) The four routines with n as the last
     argument insert at most n characters. If n<=0, then the
     entire string is inserted.

     If a character in str is a tab, newline, carriage return or
     backspace, the cursor is moved appropriately within the
     window. A newline also does a clrtoeol() before moving. Tabs
     are considered to be at every eighth column. If a character
     in str is another control character, it is drawn in the ^X
     notation. Calling winch() after adding a control character
     (and moving to it, if necessary) does not return the control
     character, but instead returns the representation of the
     control character.

RETURN VALUES
     All routines return the integer ERR upon failure and an
     integer value other than ERR upon successful completion.

     headers <stdio.h>, <stdarg.h>, and <sys/types.h>.
