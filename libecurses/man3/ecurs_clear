Curses Library Functions ecurs_clear



NAME
     ecurs_clear - clear all or part of a curses window

SYNOPSIS
     #include <curses.h>

     int erase(void);

     int werase(WINDOW *win);

     int clear(void);

     int wclear(WINDOW *win);

     int clrtobot(void);

     int wclrtobot(WINDOW *win);

     int clrtoeol(void);

     int wclrtoeol(WINDOW *win);

DESCRIPTION
     The erase() and werase() routines copy blanks to every
     position in the window.

     The clear() and wclear() routines are like erase() and
     werase(), but they also call clearok() , so that the screen
     is cleared completely on the next call to wrefresh() for
     that window and repainted from scratch.

     The clrtobot() and wclrtobot() routines erase all lines
     below the cursor in the window. Also, the current line to
     the right of the cursor, inclusive, is erased.

     The clrtoeol() and wclrtoeol() routines erase the current
     line to the right of the cursor, inclusive.

RETURN VALUES
     All routines return the integer OK, or a non-negative
     integer if immedok() is set. See ecurs_outopts.
