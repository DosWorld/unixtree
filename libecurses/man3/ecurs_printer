Curses Library Functions ecurs_printer



NAME
     ecurs_printer - Output data to a printer

SYNOPSIS
     #include <curses.h>

     PRINTER *win_prt_open(SCREEN *s, int mode,
         const char *str, char *msgbuf);

     int win_prt_close(SCREEN *s, PRINTER *p,
         char *msgbuf);

     int win_prt_output_str(SCREEN *s, PRINTER *p,
         const char *str);

     int win_prt_output_fmt(SCREEN *s, PRINTER *p,
         const char *fmt, ...);

     int win_prt_output_var(SCREEN *s, PRINTER *p,
         const char *str, va_list args);

     int print_win(WINDOW *win, PRINTER *p);

DESCRIPTION
     These routines enable a user to direct output to an
     arbitrary printer. Threr are three different types of
     printer output:

         P_SPOOL     0   send output to the system print spooler
         P_PIPE      1   send output to a piped command
         P_FILE      2   send output to a file

     win_prt_open() will open a "conection" to the specified
     printer type, as follows:

         P_SPOOL     str is printer name (NULL for default)
         P_PIPE      str is the command to pipe to
         P_FILE      str is the filename to write to

     win_prt_open() returns a pointer to a PRINTER, which is used
     in all the other calls.

     win_prt_close() closes the PRINTER specified.

     win_prt_output_str() will send a string to the specified
     PRINTER.  win_prt_output_fmt() will send a formatted string
     to the specified PRINTER.  win_prt_output_var() also sends a
     formatted string, but with a variadic argument list.  It is
     the user's responsibility to provide any needed newlines.

     print_win() will print the contents of a window to the
     printer. Only the character data is printed, attributes are
     ignored.

     If the value of the SCREEN (s) is NULL, the current screen
     will be used.  The print_win() routine uses the SCREEN that
     is associated with the window being printed.

RETURN VALUES
     The routines print_win(), win_prt_close(), and
     win_prt_output_*() will return ERR if unsuccessful and OK
     if successful.

     win_prt_open() will return NULL if unsuccessful.

     If the open or close call fails, a message describing the
     failure will be put in msgbuf.  Sometimes the open will
     succeed, even though the actual print failed, in which case
     the close will generate the error.  You must check the
     return codes from both the open and the close to detect any
     errors.
