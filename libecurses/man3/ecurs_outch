NAME
     ecurs_outch - Store chtypes into a window

SYNOPSIS
     #include <curses.h>

     int outch(int y, int x, chtype c);

     int woutch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, chtype c);

     ouch(chtype c);

     wouch(WINDOW *win, chtype c);

     mvouch(int y, int x, chtype c);

     mvwouch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, chtype c);

DESCRIPTION
     These routines all store a chtype directly into a window.
     They are all macros, and do not check if the specified
     coordinates are valid.

     ouch() and wouch() store chtype c at the current position.
     The current position is not changed.

     outch() and woutch() store chtype c at the specified
     position. The current position is not changed.

     mvouch() and mvwouch() move to the specified position, then
     store the given chtype at that position.

RETURN VALUES
     All routines return the integer ERR upon failure and an
     integer value other than ERR upon successful completion.
