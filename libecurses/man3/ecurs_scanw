Curses Library Functions ecurs_scanw



NAME
     ecurs_scanw - convert formatted input from a curses widow

SYNOPSIS
     #include <curses.h>

     int scanw(char *fmt, ...);

     int wscanw(WINDOW *win, char *fmt, ...);

     int mvscanw(int y, int x, char *fmt, ...);

     int mvwscanw(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, char *fmt, ...);

     int vwscanw(WINDOW *win, char *fmt, va_list args);

DESCRIPTION
     The scanw(), wscanw(), and mvscanw() routines correspond to
     scanf() (see scanf(3C)). The effect of these routines is as
     though wgetstr() were called on the window, and the
     resulting line used as input for the scan. Fields which do
     not map to a variable in the fmt field are lost.

     The vwscanw() routine is similar to vwprintw() in that it
     performs a wscanw() using a variable argument list. The
     third argument is a va_list, a pointer to a list of
     arguments, as defined in <stdarg.h>.

RETURN VALUES
     vwscanw() returns ERR on failure and an integer equal to
     the number of fields scanned on success.

     Applications may interrogate the return value from the
     scanw, wscanw(), mvscanw(), and mvwscanw() routines to
     determine the number of fields which were mapped in the
     call.

NOTES
     The header <curses.h> automatically includes the system
     headers <stdio.h>, <stdarg.h>, and <sys/types.h>.
