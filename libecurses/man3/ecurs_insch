Curses Library Functions ecurs_insch



NAME
     ecurs_insch - insert a character before the character under
     the cursor in a curses window

SYNOPSIS
     #include <curses.h>

     int insch(chtype ch);

     int winsch(WINDOW *win, chtype ch);

     int mvinsch(int y, int x, chtype ch);

     int mvwinsch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, chtype ch);

DESCRIPTION
     With these routines, the character ch is inserted before the
     character under the cursor. All characters to the right of
     the cursor are moved one space to the right, with the
     possibility of the rightmost character on the line being
     lost. The cursor position does not change (after moving to
     y, x, if specified). (This does not imply use of the
     hardware insert character feature.)

RETURN VALUES
     All routines return the integer ERR upon failure and an
     integer value other than ERR upon successful completion.

NOTES
     The header <curses.h> automatically includes the system
     headers <stdio.h>, <stdarg.h>, and <sys/types.h>.
