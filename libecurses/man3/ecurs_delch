Curses Library Functions ecurs_delch



NAME
     ecurs_delch - delete character under cursor in a curses window

SYNOPSIS
     #include <curses.h>

     int delch(void);

     int wdelch(WINDOW *win);

     int mvdelch(int y, int x);

     int mvwdelch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x);

DESCRIPTION
     With these routines the character under the cursor in the
     window is deleted; all characters to the right of the cursor
     on the same line are moved to the left one position and the
     last character on the line is filled with a blank. The
     cursor position does not change (after moving to y, x, if
     specified). This does not imply use of the hardware delete
     character feature.

RETURN VALUES
     All routines return the integer ERR upon failure and an
     integer value other than ERR upon successful completion.

NOTES
     The header <curses.h> automatically includes the system
     headers <stdio.h>, <stdarg.h>, and <sys/types.h>.
