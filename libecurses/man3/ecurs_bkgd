Curses Library Functions ecurs_bkgd



NAME
     ecurs_bkgd - curses window background manipulation routines

SYNOPSIS
     #include <curses.h>

     int bkgd(chtype ch);

     void bkgdset(chtype ch);

     void wbkgdset(WINDOW *win, chtype ch);

     int wbkgd(WINDOW *win, chtype ch);

DESCRIPTION
     The bkgdsets() and wbkgdset() routines manipulate the
     background of the named window. Background is a chtype
     consisting of any combination of attributes and a character.
     The attribute part of the background is combined (ORed) with
     all non-blank characters that are written into the window
     with waddch(). Both the character and attribute parts of the
     background are combined with the blank characters. The
     background becomes a property of the character and moves
     with the character through any scrolling and insert/delete
     line/character operations. To the extent possible on a
     particular terminal, the attribute part of the background is
     displayed as the graphic rendition of the character put on
     the screen.

     The bkgd() and wbkgd() routines combine the new background
     with every position in the window. Background is any
     combination of attributes and a character. Only the
     attribute part is used to set the background of non-blank
     characters, while both character and attributes are used for
     blank positions. To the extent possible on a particular
     terminal, the attribute part of the background is displayed
     as the graphic rendition of the character put on the screen.

RETURN VALUES
     bkgd() and wbkgd() return the integer OK, or a non-negative
     integer, if immedok() is set. See ecurs_outopts.
