Curses Library Functions ecurs_move



NAME
     ecurs_move - move curses window cursor

SYNOPSIS
     #include <curses.h>

     int move(int y, int x);

     int wmove(WINDOW *win, int y, int x);

     int mvcur(int old_y, int old_x, int new_y, int new_x);

DESCRIPTION
     With these routines, the cursor associated with the window
     is moved to line y and column x. This routine does not move
     the physical cursor of the terminal until refresh() is
     called. The position specified is relative to the upper
     left-hand corner of the window, which is (0,0).

     The mvcur() routine positions the actual cursor on the
     display to the new coordinates, if different from the
     old coordinates. If the old coordinates are not known
     (such as after a "shell-escape"), specify (-1,-1).

RETURN VALUES
     These routines return the integer ERR upon failure and an
     integer value other than ERR upon successful completion.

NOTES
     The header <curses.h> automatically includes the system
     headers <stdio.h>, <stdarg.h>, and <sys/types.h>.
