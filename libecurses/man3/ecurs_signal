Curses Library Functions ecurs_signal



NAME
     ecurs_signal - Signal processing routines

SYNOPSIS
     #include <curses.h>
     #include <signal.h>

     void win_signal(int sig, WIN_SIG_RTN *rtn, void *data);

     WIN_SIG_RTN *win_signal_rtn(int sig);

     void *win_signal_data(int sig);

DESCRIPTION
     These routines are similar to the standard signal()
     routines, except that the user can specify a pointer to
     user data which is passed to the specified signal
     routine.

     win_signal() specifies a routine to be called and user
     data to be passed to it for the given signal value.
     If the routine specified is 0, then signal handling for
     that signal is set to the system default.  If the
     signal number is negative, then all signals are
     restored to the system default.

     win_signal_rtn() and win_signal_data() fetch values for
     a given signal.

RETURN VALUES
     win_signal_rtn() returns a pointer to the signal-routine
     specified for a given signal or 0 if none was specified.

     win_signal_data() returns a pointer to the data specified
     to be passed to the routine for a given signal.

NOTES
     The header <curses.h> automatically includes the system
     headers <stdio.h>, <stdarg.h>, and <sys/types.h>.
