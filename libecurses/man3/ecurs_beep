Curses Library Functions ecurs_beep



NAME
     ecurs_beep - curses bell and screen flash routines

SYNOPSIS
     #include <curses.h>

     int beep(void);

     int flash(void);

DESCRIPTION
     The beep() and flash() routines are used to signal the
     terminal user. The routine beep() sounds the audible alarm
     on the terminal, if possible; if that is not possible, it
     flashes the screen (visible bell), if that is possible. The
     routine flash() flashes the screen, and if that is not
     possible, sounds the audible signal. If neither signal is
     possible, nothing happens. Nearly all terminals have an
     audible signal (bell or beep), but only some can flash the
     screen.

RETURN VALUES
     These routines always return OK.
