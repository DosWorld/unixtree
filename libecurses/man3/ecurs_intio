Curses Library Functions ecurs_intio



NAME
     ecurs_intio - Read & write binary data to a stream

SYNOPSIS
     #include <curses.h>

     unsigned short get_2byte(FILE *fp);

     int put_2byte(FILE *fp, unsigned short s);

     unsigned int get_4byte(FILE *fp);

     int put_4byte(FILE *fp, unsigned int l);

DESCRIPTION
     These routines will read & write 2-byte and 4-byte binary
     words from the specified stream. It is assumed that the
     stream is in "standard" format (little-endian), so the
     files are platform-independent. The words presented or
     returned will be converted to/from "local" format.

RETURN VALUES
     The read routines will return EOF if no data is present,
     and the binary value read if sucessful.

     The write routines will return ERR if unsuccessful and
     OK if successful.

SEE ALSO
     ecurs_util, ecurs_scrdump, ecurses

NOTES
     The header <curses.h> automatically includes the system
     headers <stdio.h>, <stdarg.h>, and <sys/types.h>.

     These routines are used by getwin() and putwin() in reading
     and writing windows to a file.
