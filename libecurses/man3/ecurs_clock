NAME
     ecurs_clock - Display date & time in a window

SYNOPSIS
     #include <curses.h>

     typedef void WIN_CLOCK_RTN
                  (WINDOW * win, /* window           */
                   void * data,  /* user data        */
                   int  yr,      /* year:      yyyy  */
                   int  mo,      /* month:     1-12  */
                   int  da,      /* day:       1-31  */
                   int  hh,      /* hour:      0-23  */
                   int  mm,      /* minute:    0-59  */
                   int  ss,      /* second:    0-59  */
                   int  wday,    /* day of wk: 0-6   */
                   int  yday);   /* day of yr: 0-365 */

     int win_clock(WINDOW *win, WIN_CLOCK_RTN *rtn, void *data,
         int interval);

     void win_clock_set(int flag);

     void win_clock_check(void);

     void win_clock_active(int bf);

DESCRIPTION
     The win_clock() routine enables the user to specify a window
     in which to display a real-time clock. It is called with the
     window to display in, a void pointer to arbitrary user data,
     the name of a call-back routine to call, and the clock
     update interval. It is the responsibility of the call-back
     routine to format the display. The window will be cleared
     prior to the call and refreshed after it returns.

     win_clock_set() specifies whether to turn on or off the
     clock display. It is automatically set on when win_clock()
     is called.

     win_clock_check() will invoke a display call if the clock is
     on. This can be used to "restart" the display after a
     "shell-escape".

     win_clock_active() will suspend/resume clock processing
     without actually setting the clock on/off. This call can
     be used in a signal routine to inhibit alarm signals.
     It returns the previous state of the clock.

RETURN VALUES
     win_clock() will return the integer ERR upon failure and an
     integer value other than ERR upon successful completion.
