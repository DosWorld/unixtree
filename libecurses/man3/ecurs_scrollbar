Curses Library Functions ecurs_scrollbar



NAME
     ecurs_scrollbar - Display a scrollbar in a window

SYNOPSIS
     #include <curses.h>

     int scrollbar(WINDOW *brdr_win, WINDOW *win, int type,
         int cur, int total);

DESCRIPTION
     scrollbar() will display a scrollbar next to a window in
     a border-window, as follows:

         SCRLBAR_VL    1    vertical   to left of window
         SCRLBAR_VR    2    vertical   to right of window
         SCRLBAR_HT    3    horizontal on top of window
         SCRLBAR_HB    4    horizontal below window

     The scrollbar will use the "stipple" alternate characters
     if available, and ascii characters if not. The ascii
     characters used are "|" and "I" for vertical scrollbars,
     and "-" and "=" for horizontal scrollbars.

     The position of the "thumb" of the scrollbar is determined
     by calculating the percentage of cur/total of the width
     or height of the window.

     If cur is negative, then the scrollbar is removed.

RETURN VALUES
     All routines return the integer ERR upon failure and an
     integer value other than ERR upon successful completion.
