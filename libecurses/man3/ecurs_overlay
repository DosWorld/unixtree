Curses Library Functions ecurs_overlay



NAME
     ecurs_overlay - overlap and manipulate overlapped curses windows

SYNOPSIS
     #include <curses.h>

     int overlay(WINDOW *srcwin, WINDOW *dstwin);

     int overwrite(WINDOW *srcwin, WINDOW *dstwin);

     int copywin(WINDOW *srcwin, WINDOW *dstwin, int sminrow,
         int smincol, int dminrow, int dmincol, int dmaxrow,
         int dmaxcol, int overlay);

DESCRIPTION
     The overlay() and overwrite() routines overlay srcwin on top
     of dstwin. scrwin and dstwin are not required to be the same
     size; only text where the two windows overlap is copied. The
     difference is that overlay() is non-destructive (blanks are
     not copied) whereas overwrite() is destructive.

     The copywin() routine provides a finer granularity of
     control over the overlay() and overwrite() routines. Like
     in the prefresh() routine, a rectangle is specified in the
     destination window, (dminrow, dmincol) and (dmaxrow,
     dmaxcol), and the upper-left-corner coordinates of the
     source window, (sminrow, smincol). If the argument overlay
     is true, then copying is non-destructive, as in overlay().

RETURN VALUES
     Routines that return an integer return ERR upon failure and
     an integer value other than ERR upon successful completion.

NOTES
     The header <curses.h> automatically includes the system
     headers <stdio.h>, <stdarg.h>, and <sys/types.h>.
