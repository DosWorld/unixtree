Curses Library Functions ecurs_deleteln



NAME
     ecurs_deleteln - delete and insert lines in a curses window

SYNOPSIS
     #include <curses.h>

     int deleteln(void);

     int wdeleteln(WINDOW *win);

     int insdelln(int n);

     int winsdelln(WINDOW *win, int n);

     int insertln(void);

     int winsertln(WINDOW *win);

DESCRIPTION
     With the deleteln() and wdeleteln() routines, the line under
     the cursor in the window is deleted; all lines below the
     current line are moved up one line. The bottom line of the
     window is cleared. The cursor position does not change. This
     does not imply use of a hardware delete line feature.

     With the insdelln() and winsdelln() routines, for positive
     n, insert n lines into the specified window above the
     current line. The n bottom lines are lost. For negative n,
     delete n lines (starting with the one under the cursor), and
     move the remaining lines up. The bottom n lines are cleared.
     The current cursor position remains the same.

     With the insertln() and insertln() routines, a blank line is
     inserted above the current line and the bottom line is lost.
     This does not imply use of a hardware insert line feature.

RETURN VALUES
     All routines return the integer ERR upon failure and an
     integer value other than ERR upon successful completion.
