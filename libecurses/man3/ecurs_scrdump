Curses Library Functions ecurs_scrdump



NAME
     ecurs_scrdump - read (write) a curses screen from (to) a file

SYNOPSIS
     #include <curses.h>

     int scr_dump(char *filename);

     int scr_restore(char *filename);

     int scr_init(char *filename);

     int scr_set(char *filename);

DESCRIPTION
     With the scr_dump() routine, the current contents of the
     virtual screen are written to the file filename.

     With the scr_restore() routine, the virtual screen is set to
     the contents of filename, which must have been written using
     scr_dump(). The next call to doupdate() restores the screen
     to the way it looked in the dump file.

     With the scr_init() routine, the contents of filename are
     read in and used to initialize the curses data structures
     about what the terminal currently has on its screen. If the
     data is determined to be valid, curses bases its next update
     of the screen on this information rather than clearing the
     screen and starting from scratch. scr_init() is used after
     initscr() or a system call to share the screen with another
     process which has done a scr_dump() after its endwin() call.

     The scr_set() routine is a combination of scr_restore() and
     scr_init(). It tells the program that the information in
     filename is what is currently on the screen, and also what
     the program wants on the screen. This can be thought of as a
     screen inheritance function.

     To read (write) a window from (to) a file, use the getwin()
     and putwin() routines (see ecurs_util).

RETURN VALUES
     All routines return the integer ERR upon failure and OK upon
     success.
