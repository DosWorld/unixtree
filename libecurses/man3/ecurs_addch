Curses Library Functions ecurs_addch



NAME
     ecurs_addch - add a character (with attributes) to a curses
     window and advance cursor

SYNOPSIS
     #include <curses.h>

     int addch(chtype ch);

     int waddch(WINDOW *win, chtype ch);

     int mvaddch(int y, int x, chtype ch);

     int mvwaddch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, chtype ch);

     int echochar(chtype ch);

     int wechochar(WINDOW *win, chtype ch);

DESCRIPTION
     With the addch(), waddch(), mvaddch(), and mvwaddch()
     routines, the character ch is put into the window at the
     current cursor position of the window and the position of
     the window cursor is advanced. Its function is similar to
     that of putchar(). At the right margin, an automatic newline
     is performed. At the bottom of the scrolling region, if
     scrollok() is enabled, the scrolling region is scrolled up
     one line.

     If the text part of ch is a control character, the
     following actions take place:

         CR    move to (row,0)
         TAB   insert spaces up to next tab position
         BS    move to (row,col-1) if not at start-of-line
         NL    clear the line and move to (row+1,0)
         FF    clear the window and move to (0,0)
         VT    move to (row+1,col)
         BL    beep

     All other control characters are ignored.  Tab positions
     are considered to be at every eighth column, unless
     set otherwise. Calling winch() after adding a control
     character does not return the control character, since no
     special character was actually put in the window.

     Video attributes can be combined with a character by OR-ing
     them into the parameter. This results in these attributes
     also being set. (The intent here is that text, including
     attributes, can be copied from one place to another using
     inch() and addch().) (see standout(), predefined video
     attribute constants, on the ecurs_attr page).

     The echochar() and wechochar() routines are functionally
     equivalent to a call to addch() followed by a call to
     refresh(), or a call to waddch followed by a call to
     wrefresh().

RETURN VALUES
     All routines return the integer ERR upon failure and an
     integer value other than ERR upon successful completion.
