Curses Library Functions ecurs_getstr



NAME
     ecurs_getstr - get character strings from curses terminal keyboard

SYNOPSIS
     #include <curses.h>

     int getstr(char *str);

     int wgetstr(WINDOW *win, char *str);

     int mvgetstr(int y, int x, char *str);

     int mvwgetstr(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, char *str);

     int getnstr(char *str, int n);

     int wgetnstr(WINDOW *win, char *str, int n);

DESCRIPTION
     The effect of getstr() is as though a series of calls to
     getch() were made, until a newline or carriage return is
     received. The resulting value is placed in the area pointed
     to by the character pointer str. wgetnstr() reads at most n
     characters, thus preventing a possible overflow of the input
     buffer. The user's erase and kill characters are
     interpreted, as well as any special keys (such as function
     keys, HOME key, and ARROW keys.)

RETURN VALUES
     All routines return the integer ERR upon failure and the
     number of characters read (not including the cr) upon success.

SEE ALSO
     ecurs_getch, ecurses

NOTES
     The header <curses.h> automatically includes the system
     headers <stdio.h>, <stdarg.h>, and <sys/types.h>.
