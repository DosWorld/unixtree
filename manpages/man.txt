.SH Description
'
.\" The next line is the define-string for the program name
.\" See the top of this file for info ...
.B "${PKG}"
is a full-screen, interactive file management
program.
With \fB${PKG}\fP,
you can view directories in a tree-like
display, and change the way that
files and directories are displayed.
\fB${PKG}\fP also provides extensive file
and directory management commands, as well
as context-sensitive, online help.
.PP
To run \fB${PKG}\fP, enter:
.PP
.RS
${PGM}
.RE
.PP
When you start \fB${PGM}\fP, the program
searches the filesystem, beginning at a specific
point, and logs
information about the files and directories
below that point.
This collection of information is called a
.I node.
.PP
If you do not specify a node on the command line
when you start
.I ${PGM},
the program logs the default node, which is
your home directory unless otherwise changed.
You can override this default by setting the
.SM ${PRF}NODE
environment variable.
See the section "Environment Variables" for more information about
available \fB${PKG}\fP environment variables.
.PP
On-line, context-sensitive help is available at
any time within \fB${PKG}\fP by pressing
.B F1.
See the section "Help" for a description of the help system.
'
.SH Options
'
There are several options available on the command
line, which you can either turn on or turn off.
To turn an option on, specify it with a plus sign (+),
for example:
.PP
.RS
${PGM}\0+n
.RE
.PP
To turn it off, specify it with a minus sign (\(mi),
for example:
.PP
.RS
${PGM}\0-n
.RE
.PP
Available options are:
.TP
.B a
This option causes
.B ${PKG}
to start up with the Applications Menu.
(See the upcoming section, "Applications Menu").
.TP
.B c
This option controls whether alternate character sets
are to be used to display the line-drawing characters.
.TP
.B k
If you turn on the
.B k
option, \fB${PKG}\fP automatically resolves
symbolic links at logging time.
If it is off, symbolic links are are logged as such.
By default, this option is turned off.
.TP
.B m
When you turn on the
.B m
option,
.B ${PKG}
continues logging a node even when it crosses
a mount point for a mounted filesystem.
By default, this option is turned on and
mounted sub-directories are logged.
.TP
.B n
This option controls whether or not
\fB${PKG}\fP logs remote (network) filesystems.
If
.B n
is on, \fB${PKG}\fP logs only local filesystems
and does not log network filesystems.
By default, this option is turned on.
.TP
.B r
This runs \fB${PKG}\fP in read-only mode.
In this mode, you cannot change or delete
any files in any of the nodes you log.
By default, this option is turned off.
.TP
.B v
This option tells \fB${PKG}\fP to just display the current
version & release and exit.
.TP
.B w
This option controls whether \fB${PKG}\fP should run in a
separate window. If you are not running in an X11 environment,
this option cannot be honored. The separate window allows full
use of color and the mouse.
.TP
.B x
If this option is turned on, then any current checkpoint file
will be loaded instead of logging the default node. This option
is ignored if a node is specified on the command line or if no
checkpoint file is found.
.TP
.B "e" "<dir>"
This option names a directory which is to be "skipped" when logging
a node in automatic mode. All directories encountered with this
name are not logged. This is useful, for example, when logging a
source tree which has SCCS sub-directories, but you are not interested
in seeing them. The "-e SCCS" option will skip all such directories.
This option may appear more than once to skip multiple directories.
.TP
.B "l" "[" "a" "|" "m" "]"
The
.B l
option sets the logging mode.
It takes one other argument, either
.B a
for automatic logging, or
.B m
for manual logging.
By default, manual logging is on, so that
when you log a node only the first-level sub-directory
is logged.
In automatic mode, all sub-directories are logged when
you start
.B ${PKG}.
.TP
.B "t" "<term>"
This option specifies the terminal type of the display. By default,
this value is taken from the $TERM environment variable (or the
$${PRF}TERM environment variable if present).
.PP
You can turn any option on or off.
To turn on an option, use a plus sign (+) along
with the option.
To turn it off, use a minus sign (\(mi).
.PP
Note that options which take an argument can be specified with
either a "\(mi" or a "+".
.PP
See the sections "Configuration" and "Environment Variables"
for more information about configuring \fB${PKG}\fP.
'
.SH "Help"
'
.B ${PKG}
provides a context-sensitive, online help system.
Help is available at any time by pressing
.B F1.
.PP
The help system is a series of linked topics, one
topic per screen.  On the higher-level screens
there are highlighted keywords.  You select
highlighted keywords with the Tab key.
If you press Enter, you see a help screen
that provides further information about the topic.
.PP
At the top-level of the help system
is an index of the three general areas of
the help system:
.TP
.B "Using Context Sensitive Help"
This provides a general description of the help
system, including how to select topics and how to scroll through
the topic screens.
.TP
.B "Keyboard Functions"
A description of the basic keyboard functions, including how to
move around
.B "${PKG}" "."
.TP
.B "Commands"
Descriptions of all
.B ${PKG}
commands and how to use them.
.PP
To go to the index at any time within the help
system, press
.B i.
'
.SH "Configuration"
'
\fB${PKG}\fP has a built-in, menu-driven Configuration Tool,
available from the Directory Window by pressing
.B Alt-F10.
With the Configuration Tool, you can
change any of the options described above, and many
other aspects of the program, including screen colors
and the behavior of various prompts.
You can also use the Configuration Tool to change
such defaults as the start-up node, printer, editor, viewer,
and certain aspects of printing.
.PP
By default, changes you make to the \fB${PKG}\fP configuration are
stored in the file
.B ${PGM}\&.rc
in your ${PKG} home directory.
You can also save changes to another filename for testing
purposes.
System-wide changes can be placed in the file
.B ${PGM}\&.rc
in the ${PKG} system directory.
.PP
'
.SH "Terminal Definitions"
'
In order to make full use of
.B ${PKG}
with a specific character-based terminal,
you may have to supplement the standard
terminal definition, or create an
.B ${PKG}
terminal definition file.
An
.B ${PKG}
terminal definition file describes keyboard
and screen capabilities, and its name is composed
of the terminal name and a
.I \&.trm
suffix.
The terminal name must be whatever is assigned in
the TERM or ${PRF}TERM variables.
For example, this terminal definition file
is for an ANSI terminal, "ansi":
.PP
.RS
ansi.trm
.RE
.PP
When
.B ${PKG}
starts, it
uses the following rules to process a terminal
definition:
.TP
.B 1.
Load any internal, \fB${PKG}\fP default definitions.
.TP
.B 2.
If $TERM or $${PRF}TERM are defined, look up the terminal
type in the \fBtermcap\fP or \fBterminfo\fP database
and load the appropriate entry.
.TP
.B 3.
Look for a file called \fB$TERM.trm\fP or \fB$${PRF}TERM.trm\fP.  Search
the path specified by the $${PRF}PATH variable.  For each directory in
this path, both that directory and a \fBtrm\fP sub-directory is searched.
.TP
.B 4.
If either \fB$TERM.trm\fP or \fB$${PRF}TERM.trm\fP
exist, use the information in those files to augment previous definitions.
.TP
.B 5.
Look for a \fBuser.trm\fP file, and, if found, load it to augment
previous definitions.
.PP
Note that the ${PRF}TERM variable takes precedence over the standard TERM
variable.
.PP
There are two parts to a \fB\&.trm\fP file, although the lines may
be in any order in the file.  The first part defines the keyboard
and the second part defines the screen.
.PP
A \fB\&.trm\fP file is a plain-text file that contains only printable
characters.  The syntax for keyboard definitions is:
.PP
.RS
key-name\0\0=\0\0"encoded sequence"
.br
key-name\0\0=\0\0name
.RE
.PP
For screen definitions:
.PP
.RS
ability-name\0\0=\0\0"encoded sequence"
.RE
.PP
If your terminal does not have a complete
set of function keys or other important
keys, you can define alternate keystrokes
in the \fB\&.trm\fP file.
This is done with the following variables:
.TP
.B Kfunc
Alternate function key
.TP
.B Kalt\0\0
Alternate Alt key
.TP
.B Kctrl
Alternate Ctrl key
.TP
.B Kshift
Alternate Shift key
.PP
By default, the Kfunc variable is defined as Ctl-].
.B ${PKG}
does not define Kalt, Kctrl, and Kshift by default.
.PP
To change one of the alternate key mappings, redefine
it in the \fB\&.trm\fP file.  For example:
.PP
.RS
Kfunc\0\0=\0\0"^v"
.RE
.PP
This defines the alternate function key as Ctl-v.
Note that in the file you do not place a Ctl-v, but rather
a carat (^) and the letter "v".
.PP
Along with the Kfunc, Kalt, Kshift, and Kctrl keys,
you use one of the following keys:
.TP
.B u
Up-arrow
.TP
.B d
Down-arrow
.TP
.B l
Left-arrow
.TP
.B r
Right-arrow
.TP
.B h
Home
.TP
.B e
End
.TP
.B p
Page Up
.TP
.B n
Page Down
.TP
.B x
Escape (Esc)
.TP
.B w
Refresh screen
.TP
.B q
Print Screen (print current screen to printer)
.TP
.B a
Alt (Kalt)
.TP
.B c
Ctrl (Kctrl)
.TP
.B s
Shift (Kshift)
.TP
.B k
Caps Lock
.TP
.B m
Num Lock
.TP
.B ^x
<control-x>
.PP
For example, to obtain a ^M (control-m):
.PP
.RS
^M or ^m
.RE
.PP
.TP
.B 1-0 \(mi +
Function keys F1 through F12.
.PP
For example, to obtain the function key ALT F10:
.PP
.RS
Ctl-] a Ctl-] 0
.RE
.PP
For more information about terminal configuration
and terminal definitions, see the file TERMFILES in the
${PKG} system directory.
'
.SH "Environment Variables"
'
.B ${PKG}
uses the following environment variables:
.TP
.B ${PRF}HOME
This is the default user's home ${PKG} directory.  If not specified,
the default is "~/\&.${PGM}".
.TP
.B ${PRF}PATH
This is a list of directories that \fB${PKG}\fP searches
for configuration files.
The default path is
.B "\&.:<${PKG} home directory>:<${PKG} system directory>".
.TP
.B ${PRF}NODE
This is the default node to log when the
user runs
.I ${PGM}
and no node is specified on the command line.
If
.SM ${PRF}NODE
is not set to a specific value, the
default node is the user's home directory.
You can override this by specifying
a node to log on the command line when
you run
.I ${PGM}.
.TP
.B ${PRF}TERM
This variable contains the terminal type to use.
If it is not explicitly set, the value of the
standard
.SM TERM
variable is used.
If
.SM ${PRF}TERM
is explicitly set, that value overrides
.SM TERM.
Note that the "-t <term>" option will override this.
.TP
.B ${PRF}PRINTER
Either a printer name or a system command to use when
sending output to the printer.  If not set, the default
printer will be used.  If it starts with a "|", it is
assumed to be a command to be executed.  If it starts
with a ">", it is assumed to be a filename to write to.
For example:
.PP
.RS
"laser"
.RE
.RS
"| lp\0-dlaser"
.RE
.RS
"> printer.txt"
.RE
.PP
.TP
.B ${PRF}EDITOR
System command to execute when you choose the
.B ${PKG}
edit command.
For example:
.PP
.RS
/bin/vi
.RE
.PP
.TP
.B ${PRF}HEXEDITOR
System command to execute when you choose the
.B ${PKG}
hex-edit command.
For example:
.PP
.RS
/usr/bin/hexedit
.RE
.PP
If this variable is not explicitly set, \fB${PKG}\fP uses
its own, internal hex-edit engine.
.TP
.B ${PRF}VIEWER
The viewer command to use when examining
files.
If this variable is not explicitly set, \fB${PKG}\fP uses
its own, internal viewer.
.PP
.TP
.B ${PRF}DIFF
The diff command to use when comparing files.
If this variable is not explicitly set, \fB${PKG}\fP uses
its own, internal diff engine.
.PP
.TP
.B ${PRF}INIT
The initialization file to use instead of the standard
${PGM}.rc file.  This may be a full pathname, or just
a filename (in which case it will be looked for in the
${PRF}PATH).  This option can be used to test a new configuration file.
.TP
.B ${PRF}MAGIC
The list of magic files to use in querying file contents.
The default magic path is
.B <${PKG} home dir>/magic:<${PKG} system dir>/magic:/etc/magic.
.PP
These configuration variables (with the exception of $${PRF}INIT)
can be modified by changing the configuration settings with the
Configuration Tool.
'
.SH "Applications Menu"
'
.B ${PKG}
provides a mechanism by which you can build
a custom menu of commands, called the
Applications Menu.
The Applications Menu is set up in the file
.B ${PGM}.mnu,
which contains extensive comments that
describe its format and how to configure the
file.
.PP
The Applications menu is useful for keeping
frequently-run system programs, such as mail,
news readers, network commands, and so forth.
There can only be one system
.B ${PGM}.mnu
file on the system, but each user may have his own
${PGM}.mnu file in his ${PKG} home or current directory.
