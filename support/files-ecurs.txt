	lib/libmenu.a		The menu    library
	lib/libpanel		The panel   library
	lib/libxvt.a		The xvt     library

Headers:
	include/curses.h	The header for the ecurses library.

	include/term.h		The header for low-level terminfo routines.
				Not needed for normal curses use.

	include/termcap.h	The header for low-level termcap routines.
				Not needed for normal curses use.

	include/form.h		The header for the form library.
				Not needed for normal curses use.

	include/menu.h		The header for the menu library.
				Not needed for normal curses use.

	include/panel.h		The header for the panel library.

				not have this header.
				Not needed for normal curses use.

	include/libxvt.h	The header for the xvt library.
				Only needed if using the XVT library.

	include/sysmem.h	A header for the malloc-interface used by
				these libraries.  It is made available for

				programs (A Good Thing To Do).

	include/sysopt.h	A header which defines replacement routines for
				getopt(), which is not available on all systems.
				This is provided for portability purposes,
				although it also provides extended capabilities.

	include/syssig.h	A header for our signal interface, which
				provides signal routines with a user-defined
				data pointer.

	include/systhread.h	A header for our interface for threads and
				mutexes.  This is provided for portability
