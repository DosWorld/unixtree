Installation notes for ${PKG}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Unix packages are all distributed as compressed tar files.
To install any of these packages, do the following:

1.	Pick a directory to install ${PKG} in.
	We recommend /usr/local/${PGM} if you are installing this
	program for everyone, otherwise use ~/${PGM} for your personal copy.

	Note that to install into /usr/local you may need to have root
	permission.

2.	Execute the following commands:

	Note: in the following commands,
	<download-dir>		refers to the directory you downloaded the
				install package into.
	<install-package>	refers to the file you downloaded (minus any
				.Z or .gz extension).
	<install-dir>		refers to the directory you wish to install in.

	Uncompress the downloaded package:

	$ cd <download-dir>
	$ uncompress <install-package>.Z
		or
	$ gunzip <install-package>.gz

	Install the package:

	$ mkdir -p <install-dir>
	$ cd <install-dir>
	$ tar xvf <download-dir>/<install-package>

	Remove the download file if desired:

	$ rm <download-dir>/<install-package>

3.	Add the install directory to your path to make it accessable:

	Users of sh, ksh, bash, or any other sh-like shell:

		$ PATH=$PATH:<install-dir>	export PATH

		You can do this automatically each time you (or anyone)
		logs in by adding that line to either your personal
		~/.profile file or to the system-wide /etc/profile file.

	Users of csh, tcsh, or any other csh-like shell:

		% set path=($path <install-dir>)

		You can do this automatically each time you (or anyone)
		logs in by adding that line to either your personal
		~/.cshrc file or to the system-wide /etc/cshrc file.

4.	To access the ${PGM} man page, you need to add the appropriate
	${PKG} man directory to your MANPATH.

	There are two man directories, one for systems whose man program
	supports "man" format files (like Solaris and HP/ux), and
	one for other systems whose man program supports "cat" format files.

	For Unix systems which support "man" format pages, use the command:

		$ MANPATH=<install-dir>/man:$MANPATH export MANPATH

		or

		% setenv MANPATH="<install-dir>/man:$MANPATH"

	For other Unix systems, use the command:

		$ MANPATH=<install-dir>/catman:$MANPATH export MANPATH

		or

		% setenv MANPATH="<install-dir>/catman:$MANPATH"

	Note that Unix systems which support "man" format pages always also
	support "cat" format man pages.

	After this, the command "man ${PGM}" will display the man page for
	"${PGM}".

	The reason for putting the ${PGM} man directory first in the list
	is that some Unix systems have an "xt" entry in section 7 (devices),
	which describes the Xylogics Tape Driver.  So, if the ${PKG}
	man directory was at the end of the MANPATH, you would have to run
	"man 1 ${PGM}" (or "man -s1 ${PGM}" on Solaris) to specify the
	entry in section 1 (commands).

	This command, like the previous PATH addition, can be added to your
	~/.profile or /etc/profile files (sh & friends) or to your
	~/.cshrc or /etc/cshrc files (csh & friends).

	You can also just view the file <install-dir>/catman/man1/${PGM}.1
	using any viewer such as "more" or with an editor such as "vi".

5.	Platform-specific installs

	For Linux users, there is an RPM file which can be used instead of
	the standard TAR file.  Just use the command "rpm -Uhv <package>.rpm".
	Note that you must have root permission to use this command.

	For SVR4 users, there are PKGADD files which can be used instead of
	the standard TAR files.  Just uncompress the appropriate file,
	and use the command "pkgadd -d <package>.pkg".
	Note that you must have root permission to use this command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3.x update notes:

If you are updating ${PKG} from version 2.2.x, you may
want to move your old user-specific files to the new ones (if they exist).

The files which have changed are:

	old file	new file		description
	-----------	--------------------	----------------
	~/.${PGM}rc		~/.${PGM}/${PGM}.rc		configuration file
	~/.${PGM}fc		~/.${PGM}/${PGM}.fc		file-color file
	~/.${PGM}hs		~/.${PGM}/${PGM}.hst		history file

To do this, execute the following commands:

	$ mkdir ~/.${PGM}
	$ mv ~/.${PGM}rc ~/.${PGM}/${PGM}.rc	# to update the config file
	$ mv ~/.${PGM}fc ~/.${PGM}/${PGM}.fc	# to update the file-color file
	$ mv ~/.${PGM}hs ~/.${PGM}/${PGM}.hst	# to update the history file

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.x update notes:

If you are upgrading from any 2.x to 3.x, you may have to modify your
personal application menu file (${PGM}.mnu) if you have one.  The keyword
"any" is no longer recognized.

A command to do this is as follows:

	$ ex ~/.${PGM}/${PGM}.mnu << EOF
	> set ic
	> g/\\<any\\>//s/*/g
	> wq
	> EOF

Note that the delivered application menu file does not contain
the "any" keyword.
