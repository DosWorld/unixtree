HELP_REG_DIR_COMPARE
Compare directory command
Available from: Directory Commands menu\
\
This command compares the files in the current directory\
with those in another directory, and tags those that\
meet comparison critera that you select.\
\
When you select the Compare command, you are prompted\
to choose a directory to compare with the current one.\
You can enter the name of the directory, or use the\
arrow keys to select one from the directory tree.  If\
you have other nodes logged, you can select one of them\
by using the "<" and ">" keys.\
\
After you select a directory to compare, you are prompted\
for selection criteria.  Comparison criteria are:\
\
\cIdentical dates - Tags each file that has the same\
                  name and date as another file.\
\
\cNewest date -     Tags the most recent version of each\
                  file that is not unique; if more than\
                  one file with the same (most recent)\
                  date and name exists, all are tagged.\
\
\cUnique names -    Tags each unique file.\
\
\cOldest date -     Tags the earliest version of each\
                  file that is not unique; if more than\
                  one file with the same (earliest) date\
                  and name exists, all are tagged.\
\
A criterion is selected if you see the word "yes" next to\
it.  To switch between "yes" and "no", enter the\
highlighted letter of the criterion.  These options are\
cumulative.  That is, if you select all the options, ${PGM}\
looks for files that satisfy all the criteria.\
\
After you select the desired critera, press Enter to begin\
comparing files.  Files in the current directory are tagged\
if they compare with those in the second directory\
according to the critera you select.\
\e

HELP_REG_DIR_DELETE
Delete directory command
Available from: Directory Commands menu\
\
This command deletes the current directory.  To delete a\
directory, highlight it in the Directoy window and press\
"d".  You are prompted whether or not to delete this\
directory.  To delete the directory, press "y". To cancel\
the operation, press "n" or Esc.\
\
Note that you can only delete directories you own.  You\
cannot delete a directory that contains files.  You must\
remove all files first.  If the directory contains\
subdirectories, you must remove those first.  To remove an\
entire branch of the node, you can use the Prune command.\
\
You cannot delete the root (top-level directory) of the\
node.\
\e

HELP_REG_DIR_EDIT
Edit command
Available from: Directory Commands menu\
\
Use this command to create a file.  When you enter the Edit\
command, ${PGM} invokes a text editing program, but does not\
specify a filename.  You can then compose text and write it\
to a specific file.\
\
You can choose a particular text editor with the\
Configuration Tool (Alt-F10).\
\
\e

HELP_REG_DIR_FILESPEC
Filespec command
Available from: Directory Commands menu\
\
This command changes the file specification for displayed\
files.  Only files that match the file specification (shown\
in the File Specification box at the top right of the Main\
Display) are shown in the File windows.\
\
When you select the Filespec command, you are prompted for\
a new file specification.   You can:\
\
    - Press Enter to automatically choose the default wild\
      card (*), and specify all files.\
\
    - Enter any file specification by typing one at the\
      prompt. You can enter multiple file specifications\
      separated by commas or spaces.\
\
    - Select the previous file specification using the\
      up-arrow key.\
\
When you enter a file specification, you can use the *\
and ? characters as wild cards.  An asterisk (*) matches\
any number of characters.  A question mark matches a single\
character.  Use a minus sign (-) to display files that\
do not match the specification.\
\
For example, this file specification matches all files that\
begin with exactly two characters in their name, followed\
by a period (.), followed by any number of characters:\
\
    ??.*\
\
This example matches all files that end with a .c, .h\
or .o:\
\
    *.c, *.h, *.o\
\
As a shortcut, you can use bracket characters ([ ]) to\
specify a series of letters in a file specification.  For\
example, you could enter the previous file specification\
as:\
\
    *.[cho]\
\
To display files that do not match the specification, place\
a minus sign in front of the specification.  For example:\
\
    -*.bak\
\
The above specification matches all files that do not end\
with the string .bak.\
\
\e

HELP_REG_DIR_RELOG
Log or relog directory command (+)
Available from: Directory Commands menu\
\
This command logs an unlogged directory or relog an already\
logged directory.  When you execute the Node command, you\
are prompted whether you want to relog an existing node, or\
log a new node.  Press either "r" to relog a node, or "n"\
to log a new node.\
\
Relogging a node is useful to make sure ${PGM} contains the\
most current information about a node.  In a multiuser\
or networked system, there are many ways a node\
can change outside of ${PGM}.  For example, another user may\
have created or deleted a file in the node.  Or, if you\
have logged a directory that is used by system\
programs to store or create temporary or log files, those\
programs may have added or deleted files since the last\
time you logged the directory.\
\
You need to relog a node if you use either the Shell or\
eXec commands to add or delete files and directories\
in a logged node.  ${PGM} does not automatically relog a\
node if you make changes to it from the command line.\
\e

HELP_REG_DIR_LOG_RECURS
Recursive relog directory command (*)
Available from: Directory Commands menu\
\
These commands log an unlogged subdirectory or relog an\
already logged subdirectory.  A directory that is not\
logged is indicated in the Directory window with a plus\
sign (+).

To relog the directory, and all subdirectories below it,\
use the arrow keys to highlight the directory, then press\
"*".
\
You can also log and relog only the top subdirectory in a\
branch with the plus (+) command.  When you highlight a\
directory and press "+", only the immediate subdirectory is\
logged.  Directories below it are not logged.  If they were\
unlogged with the unlog directory command (-), they are\
still unlogged and are displayed in the Directory window\
with a plus sign (+).\
\e

HELP_REG_DIR_UNLOG
Unlog directory command (-)
Available from: Directory Commands menu\
\
This command unlogs a subdirectory.  When you unlog a\
subdirectory, ${PGM} removes information about it from the\
node (it does not actually remove the directory).  The\
subdirectory is indicated in the Directory window by a\
plus sign (+).  In the File window you see the words "Not\
logged".\
\
To unlog a directory, highlight it with the arrow keys,\
then press "-".\
\
To relog the subdirectory, use either the relog (+) or\
recursive relog (*) commands.  To relog a directory,\
highlight it with the arrow keys, then press either "+" or\
"*".\

# Alt directory commands
#
HELP_ALT_DIR_COMPACT
Compact command
Available from: Alt Directory menu (F4)\
\
This command compacts directories by removing unused space\
in the directory file itself.  Compacting a directory can\
improve the speed at which the directory is accessed, for\
example when initially logging a node, or when running\
system commands.  This is especially apparent if the\
directory contains many files, if files are frequently\
added and deleted, or if many files are deleted from a\
large directory.\
\
To run the Compact command, press Esc until you are at the\
Directory Commands menu.  Use the arrow keys to highlight\
the directory you want to compact.  Execute the Compact\
command by pressing F4, then "c", or by pressing Alt-c.\
\

Press "y" to compact the directory, or "n" to cancel the\
command.\
\e

HELP_ALT_DIR_DIRDISP
Directory display command
Available from: Alt Directory or Alt File menu (F4)\
\
This command changes the way that directories are shown in\
the Directory window.  You can choose among four different\
display styles, each providing particular kinds of\
information about the directories.\
\
To change the directory display, execute the Directory\
Display command.  Either press F4 followed by "d",  or\
press Alt-d.  The directory display changes from a tree to\
a multicolumn format.  Each time you use the Directory\
Display command, the format changes.  You can cycle through\
the four different formats by repeatedly using the\
Directory Display command.\
\
The formats provide different kinds of information:\
\
    - The default format (unless you change it with the\
      Configuration Tool), is the tree format; this\
      represents your directories graphically, making it\
      easy to see the tree-like structure of the node.\
\
    - The second format contains five columns.\
\
      The first column is the name of the directory.  The\
      second is its position in the node (0 is the root of\
      the node, 1 is for directories connected to the root,\
      2 is for the next level of directories, and so\
      forth).  The third column is the number of files in\
      that directory.  The fourth column is the number of\
      bytes those files consume.  The fifth column is the\
      total number of bytes in all subdirectories below\
      the particular directory.\
\
    - The third format displays the directory name, its\
      position in the node, the number of bytes the\
      directory file itself consumes (as opposed to the\
      bytes consumed by files in the directory), and the\
      date and time the directory was last modified (a file\
      was added to the directory, or a subdirectory was\
      created).\
\
    - The fourth format shows the directory name, its\
      position in the node, the inode number of the\
      directory, the access permissions for the directory,\
      the owner and the group affiliation of the\
      directory.\
\e

HELP_ALT_DIR_FILEDISP
File display command
Available from: Alt Directory menu (F4)\
\
This command changes the way that files are displayed in\
the File windows.  Execute the command by pressing F4 and\
"f", or by pressing Alt-f.  Each time you execute the\
command, you choose one of four display formats.\
\
The formats provide different kinds of information about\
files:\
\
    - The first format lists the names of the files in\
      either one, two or three columns, depending upon the\
      number of files in the directory.  This is the\
      default, unless you change it with the Configuration\
      Tool.\
\
    - The second format shows the name of the file and its\
      size.\
\
    - The third format shows the name of the file, its size,\
      the number of links to that file (there is always at\
      least one link, which is the file itself), the file's\
      inode number, and the date and time the file was last\
      modified.\
\
    - The fourth format shows the name of the file, its size,\
      its access permissions, and its owner and group\
      affiliation.\
\e

HELP_ALT_DIR_INVERT
Alt Invert command
Available from: Alt Directory menu (F4)\
\
This command inverts the tag status of selected files.\
Files that are tagged are untagged, and those that are not\
tagged are tagged.\
\
Files can be selected based on the following criteria:\
\
    \lHELP_TAG_INODE:Inode number\l\
    \lHELP_TAG_LINKS:Link count\l\
    \lHELP_TAG_SIZE :File size\l\
    \lHELP_TAG_PERMS:Permissions\l\
    \lHELP_TAG_OWNER:Owner\l\
    \lHELP_TAG_GROUP:Group\l\
    \lHELP_TAG_DATE :Date\l\
    \lHELP_TAG_NODE :Node\l\
    \lHELP_TAG_TYPE :Type\l\
\e

HELP_ALT_DIR_GRAFT
Graft command
Available from: Alt Directory menu (F4)\
\
This command moves (grafts) a directory structure and all\
the files in it to another directory. It copies tagged\
files and directories to any destination and then deletes\
those files from their original location.\
\
To use the Graft command, tag all the files in the\
directory you want to move.  With that directory still\
highlighted, press F4 and "g", or press Alt-g.  You are\
prompted whether or not to graft this directory.  Press "y"\
to continue grafting, or "n" to cancel the operation.\
\
Next, you are prompted to enter the name of destination\
directory.  Enter the name of the directory, or use the\
arrow keys to point to the destination directory.  If you\
already have logged multiple nodes, you can choose from the\
list of nodes using the < and > keys.  Note that the\
destination directory must be in the same filesystem as the\
directory you are grafting.  When you have chosen the\
destination directory, press Enter to begin grafting.\
\
A useful command to tag all the files and subdirectories of\
particular file is the File Alt Tag command, available from\
the File window.\
\e

HELP_ALT_DIR_NODE
Alt Node command
Available from: Alt Directory or Alt File menu (F4)\
\
Use this command to release all logged nodes, then either:\

delete.  Enter the File window and press F3 and "d".\
\
You are prompted to whether or not to confirm each file\
before it is deleted.  Press "y" to confirm each deletion,\
and "n" to delete all the files immediately.  If you are\
deleting a large number of tagged files, you may want to\
confirm each file to be sure you do not remove important\
files.  Also, this command deletes all tagged files, so you\
may want to confirm each deletion in case you have\
forgotten about an important tagged file that you do not\
want to erase.\
\
If you ask to confirm each file before it is deleted, you\
are prompted whether or not to delete each of the tagged\
files.  Press "y" to delete the file and "n" to keep the\
file.  If you do not ask to confirm each file, all the\
tagged files on the node are immediately removed.\

HELP_TAG_FILE_EXTRACT
Extract files command
Available from: Tag File menu\
\
This command is used to extract all tagged files from\
a logged archive (bar, tar, or cpio).\
\e

HELP_TAG_FILE_BATCH
shEllscript command
Available from: Tag File menu\
\
Use this command to create a shellscript (a collection of\
system commands) and run it on tagged files.  The\
commands you specify in the shellscript are repeated once\
for each file that is tagged.\
\
When you use the shEllscript command, you can choose from\
four keywords, $1, $2, $3, and $4,  that correspond to\
files and directories.  The following list describes these\
keywords and the values with which they are replaced.\
\
    - $1:  Automatically replaced by the current path (see\
      the System Path line at the top of the screen).\
\
    - $2:  Automatically replaced by the name of the\
      current directory.\
\
    - $3:  Automatically replaced by the name of each\
      tagged file, in succession.\
\
    - $4:  Automatically replaced by the name of the parent\
      directory.\
\
The following demonstrates how to create a simple shellscript\
that uses the system "grep" utility to locate the\
string "printer" in a series of tagged files:\
\
\
1. Tag the files on which you want to operate.  Do\
   this using whatever variation of the Tag command is\
   convenient (such as Tag Directory commands, Tag File\
   commands, and so forth).\
\
2. Enter the File window and press F3.\
\
3. Press "e" to select the shEllscript command.  You\
   are prompted for the name of the script that you are\
   about to create, for example "findit".\
\
4. Enter the name of the script, "findit", and press\
   Enter.  You are prompted for the template.  The template\
   is simply the command that you want to run in the\
   script.  You can use the shEllscript command keywords on\
   this line.\
\
5. Enter the command (template) you want to run on all the\
   tagged files.  For this example, search for the string\
   printer in each file.  Type "grep printer $3" and press\
   Enter.\
\
   ${PGM} builds the shellscript file, "findit". You are\
   returned to the File window and the last tagged file is\
   highlighted.\
\
6. Press "x" to execute the script.  At the prompt, enter\
   the name of the script, "findit", and press Enter.\
\
   The screen clears, the "findit" script is executed and\
   the results are displayed.\
\e

HELP_TAG_FILE_INVERT
Tag invert file command
Available from: Tag File menu\
\
This command inverts the tag status of all tagged files.\
Files that were tagged are untagged, and files that were\
not tagged are tagged.\
\e

HELP_TAG_FILE_LINK
Tag link file command
Available from: Tag File menu\
\
This command is used to link all tagged files.  This\
command is most useful to link several files to another\
directory, keeping the same filenames.\
\
A link is simply another name for the same file.  When you\
change one file, for example by editing it, the other file\
changes as well.  This is because they are not separate\
files, but actually the same file under different names.\
\
To link all tagged files, enter the File window.  Press\
F3 and "l". You are prompted for the name of the file to\
which to link this file.  Enter the name and press Enter,\
or, if you are linking several files to another directory,\
press enter to use the same filenames.\
\
Next, you are prompted for a destination directory.  Press\
F2 to choose a different directory.  When you press F2, a\
directory screen appears.  Use the arrow keys to select the\
destination directory, then press Enter.  Press Enter again\
to make the link.\
\
To make the link in the current directory, enter a\
period (.).\
\e

HELP_TAG_FILE_MOVE
Tag move file command
Available from: Tag File menu\
\
This command moves all tagged files.  To execute the\
command, enter the File window. Press F3 and "m".  You are\
prompted for a new file name.  Enter a new name, or press\
Enter to keep the same name.\
\
Next, you are prompted for a destination directory.  Press\
F2 to see a list of directories.  If you press F2, you see\
a directory window.  Use the arrow keys to highlight the\
destination directory, or use the < and > keys to choose a\
different logged node.  Press Enter to choose the\
directory.  Press Enter again to move the tagged files to\
that directory.\
\
To select the current directory, enter a period (.) at the\
destination directory prompt.  Note that you cannot move a\
file from one node to another.  If you want to do this, you\
must copy the file with the Copy command, then delete the\
original file.\
\e

HELP_TAG_FILE_COMPARE
cOmpare tagged  files command
Available from: Tag File menu\
\
The cOmpare command compares all tagged files with the\
current file.  Files that meet the criterion you choose\
(either the Same or Different) are left tagged, and those\
that do not meet the criterion are untagged.\
\
To execute the command, enter the File window.  Press F3\
and "o".  You are prompted whether to identify files that\
are the same or different.  Type "s" for files that are the\
same, and "d" for files that are different.  Files that\
meet the criterion you select remain tagged while those\
that do not are untagged.\
\e

HELP_TAG_FILE_PRINT
Tag print file command
Available from: Tag File menu\
\
This command prints all tagged files on the system\
printer.  To execute the command, enter the File window.\
Press F3 and "p". You are prompted whether you really want\
to print all tagged files.  Type "y" print all tagged files\
and "n" to cancel the operation.\
\e

HELP_TAG_FILE_RENAME
Tag rename file command
Available from: Tag File menu\
\
This command renames any tagged files.  This command is\
most useful when renaming a single tagged file.\
\
To execute the command, tag the file you want to rename.\
Enter the File window.  Press F3 and "r".  You are prompted\
for the new name of the file.  Type the name to which you\
want to change the tagged file and press enter.  The file\
is renamed.\
\e

HELP_TAG_FILE_SEARCH
Tag search file command
Available from: Tag File menu\
\
This command searchs all tagged files for a given text\
string.  Files that contain the string remain tagged, and\
files that do not contain the string are untagged.\
\
To execute the command, enter the File window.  Press F3\
and "s".  You are prompted for a string to search for.\
Type the string and press Enter.  Each of the tagged files\
is examined, and if it contains the string it remains\
tagged.  Any files that do not contain the string are\
untagged.\
\
Not only can you search for simple text strings, but you\
can also construct complex search patterns, called "regular\
expressions". A regular expression uses wildcard characters\
and other commands with a specific syntax to locate\
patterns that are beyond the capabilities of simple\
wildcard substitutions.\
\
Available regular expression commands are\
\
    - a period (.), which matches any single character\
\
    - an asterisk (*), which matches any any number of\
      characters, including no characters at all\
      (e.g., zero or more characters)\
\
    - a plus sign (+), which matches any characters, but\
      always at least one character (e.g., one or more\
      characters)\
\
    - brackets ([ ]), which match on of the characters\
      enclosed enclosed in the brackets (for example\
      "[abcd]"), or a range of characters (for example\
      "[a-d]")\
\
    - a minus sign (-), which specifies a range of\
      characters when used inside brackets ([ ])\
\
    - the pipe character (|), which separates multiple\
      expressions.\
\
    - a carat (^), which signifies the beginning\
      of a line in an expression;  if you place the\
      carat inside brackets ([ ]), it negates the\
      specified characters (matches characters that\
      are not inside the brackets)\
\
    - a dollar sign ($), which signifies the end of\
      a line in an expression\
\
    - parentheses ( ), which causes characters enclosed\
      in them to be treated as a single unit when you\
      construct complex expressions\
\
The following examples describe various ways you can use\
the available regular expression commands:\
\
To locate occurrences of strings that start with a "c", and\
have one character separating the "c" from a "t", use the\
period ("."). For example:\
\
    c.t\
\
This matches such strings as "cat", "cut", and\
"catamaran".  Note that the search command locates strings\
even if they are part of a larger string.\
\
To search for a string that may have no characters or many\
characters, use the asterisk ("*").  For example:\
\
    T*r\
\
This matches such strings as "Tour", "Trend", "Tighter",\
and "This door".\
\
To locate strings that have at least one character, but\
possibly more, use the plus-sign ("+"). For example:\
\
    T+r\
\
This matches such strings as "Tour", "Tighter", and "This\
door".  You also can match multiple occurrences of a\
character.  For example:\
\
    Te+\
\
This matches such patterns as "Teeth" and "Tea".\
\
The following examples illustrate the difference between\
the plus-sign and an asterisk in pattern matching. A\
plus-sign matches at least one occurrence of a character.\
For example:\
\
    Te+\
\
This matches such strings as "Te", "Tee", "Teee", and so\
forth.  An asterisk matches no occurrences as well as\
single and multiple occurrences.  For example:\
\
    Te*\
\
This matches "T", "Te", "Tee", "Teee", and so forth.\
\
Use square brackets ("[" and "]") to to specify a series of\
characters, such as any pattern that contains the string\
letters "x", "y", or "z".  For example:\
\
    [xyz]\
\
You can specify a range of characters with the square\
brackets.  The following example locates the patterns\
"catA", "catB", "catC", and "catD" in a file:\
\
    cat[A-D]\
\
You can negate the meaning of the sequence inside square\
brackets by using the carat ("^").  For example:\
\
    cat[^A-D]\
\
This locates expressions that begin with "cat" but do not\
contain the letters "A" through "D".\
\
The following expression finds the patterns "cat0", "cat1",\
"cat2", and so forth, up to "cat9":\
\
    cat[0-9]\
\
You can search for multiple patterns by joining together\
pieces of an expression with a pipe (|). For example:\
\
    cat[A-D]|cat[1-2][0-9]\
\
This finds "catA", "catB", "catC", "catD", and "cat10"\
through "cat29".\
\
If you want to search for a pattern that starts at the\
beginning of a line, start the expression with a carat\
(^).  For example:\
\
    ^This is the\
\
To locate a pattern that is at the end of a line, place a\
dollar sign ($) at the end of the expression. For example:\
\
    age of Aquarius.$\
\
Use parentheses to group characters.  For example:\
\
    (Te|Too)th\
\
This matches both the patterns "Teeth" and "Tooth".\
\
To match special characters, precede them with a backslash\
(\). For example, to search for a carat:\
\
    \^\
\
Use the backslash in front of any of the special characters\
"*", "-", "[", "]", ".", "^", "$", "(", ")", and "+".\

identical to the View command available from the File menu,\
except that you can view multiple, tagged files.  You can\
choose from the tagged files by using F5 and F6.\
\
Use the View tagged files command to view the contents of\
tagged files.  The View command displays the files in a\
variety of formats.\
\
When you examine a file with view, you are placed in the\
View window.  At the top of the screen, you see the name of\
the file.  In the top, right-hand corner, you see the\
display mode:  ASCII, Dump, or Hex.  You also see whether\
or not Mask is on.  An asterisk (*) indicates that Keep\
mode is on.\
\
In the middle of the screen, you see the top portion of the\
file.  You can scroll down through the file using the arrow\
keys.  At the bottom of the screen, you see a list of\
commands.\
\
At the bottom of the View window, you see the available\
View commands:\
\
    - Edit: Edits the current file, placing you in the\
      default editor.\
\
    - Quit: Exits the View window and you return to ${PGM}.\
\
    - Search: Searches for a pattern in the file.\
\
    - Ascii: Views the current file in ASCII format. Use\
      this for plain text files.\
\
    - Dump: Views printable characters in a file without\
      any line formatting.\
\
    - Hex: Views a file as hexadecimal bytes. Use this for\
      files that contain a large number of non-displayable\
      characters, such as binary (program) files.\
\
    - Keep mode: Prevents ${PGM} from automatically\
      selecting a display format based on a file's\
      contents. Use this to view a series of files in one\
      particular format.\
\
      When Keep mode is on, you see an asterisk in the top,\
      right-hand corner of the screen, next to the other\
      mode indicators.\
\
    - Mask: Masks the eighth bit. Some programs use the\
      eighth (or high) bit to hold information. In this\
      case, you may see odd symbols or characters displayed\
      instead of plain text.  Use this command to command\
      to turn off the high bit for viewing.\
\
    - Wrap: Selects Wordwrap format.  Use this command to\
      display files that are mostly ASCII characters, but\
      contain some non-displayable characters. For example,\
      many files created with word processing programs are\
      displayed in Wordwrap format.\
\
    - Arrows: The up- and down-arrow keys scroll through\
      the file.\
\
    - F5: Selects the previous file in a list of tagged\
      files.\
\
    - F6: Selects the next file in a list of tagged files.\

HELP_ATTR_PERMS
Permissions
\
When you change the permissions of a file or directory,\
you can allow or deny access to yourself (owner), those\
users with the same group-ID as you (group), and other\
users on the system (other).  You see this prompt:\
\
                     ugs rwx rwx rwx\
  Enter permissions: 000 110 100 100\
\
The cursor starts at the first set of "rwx" characters.\
In each set, "r" indicates read access, "w" indicates\
write access, and "x" indicates permission to execute the\
file (or enter a directory).  The first "rwx" set\
corresponds to your permissions, the second corresponds\
to those users in your group, and the third corresponds\
to all other users on the system.\
\
The number "1" means access is granted, and "0" means\
access is denied. In the above example, the owner of the\
file can read and write the file, users in the owner's\
group can also read and write the file, and noone else on\
the system can access the file.  These permissions are\
typical of files that are not executable programs\
\
To change the permissions, enter the appropriate number,\
either "1" or "0".  The cursor advances to the next\
position.  You can move back to a previous selection using\
the left arrow key.\
\
Directory permissions might look something like this:\
\
    ugs rwx rwx rwx\
    000 111 101 101\
\
This allows the user complete access to the directory,\
and gives the group and others on the system the ability\
to enter this directory and read files in it.\
\
The group of characters "ugs" control the set user-ID bit\
(u), the set group-ID bit (g), and the sticky bit (s) of an\
executable program.  If the set user-ID bit is on (set to\
"1"), the program runs with the effective user-ID of the\
owner. If the set group-ID bit is on, it runs with the\
effective group-ID bit of the owner.  If the sticky bit is\
on, the program stays resident in memory after the first\
time it is executed.  Do not change these bits unless you\
are sure you know what you are doing.\
\e

HELP_ATTR_OWNER
Owner
Every file and directory on the system has an owner.\
Typically, the account that created the file owns the\
file.  However, you can give away ownership of a file to\
another account.\
\
You can change the ownership of any file that you already\
own.  Once you assign ownership of a file to another user,\
you cannot regain ownership unless you are the super user\
(root).  If you are the super user (root), you can change\
the ownership of any file on the system.\
\
When you assign ownership of a file, you can enter either\
an account name, or a user-ID number.  If you enter an\
account name, that account must already exist on the system.\
\
You can assign ownership of a file to a user-ID number\
instead of an account name.  If that user-ID number is in\
use on the system, you see the account that corresponds to\
the number when you examine the file's attributes.  If the\
user-ID number is not used by any account on the system,\
all you see for an owner is the number when you examine a\
file's attributes.\
\e

HELP_ATTR_GROUP
Group
Every file and directory on the system has a group\
affiliation. Typically, this affiliation is the same as\
that of the account that created the file or directory.\
However, you can reassign the group affiliation of a file.\
another account.\
\
You can change the group affiliation of any file or\
directory that you own.  As long as you own the file, you\
can repeatedly reassign the group affiliation.  If you are\
the super user (root), you can change the group affiliation\
of any file or directory on the system.\
\
When you assign group affiliation to a file or directory,\
you can enter either a group name, or a group-ID number.\
If you enter a group name, that group must already exist on\
the system.\
\
You can change the group affiliation of a file to a\
group-ID number instead of an account name.  If that\
group-ID number is in use on the system, you see the group\
that corresponds to the number when you examine the file's\
attributes.  If the group-ID number is not used by any\
group on the system, all you see for a group affiliation is\
the number when you examine a file's attributes.\
\e

HELP_ATTR_DATE
Date
The date of a file or directory is when it was created or\
last modified.  For a directory, the modification date is\
updated when a file is added or deleted to the directory.\
For a file, the modification date is updated when you\
change the contents of the file.  Renaming a file or\
directory does not affect its date.\
\
You can set the date of any file you own to any specific\
date, with some exceptions.\
\
The following are valid ways to specify a new date for a\
file:\
\
    November 26, 1991\
    Nov. 26, 91\
    Nov. 26\
    Nov 26 91\
    11-26\
    11/26\
    11/26/91\
    11 26 1991\
    11-26-1991\
\
If you use one of these methods, the exact time is set to\
the beginning of the day specified, which is 12:00 A.M.\
\
You can also set the date to any day of the week:\
"monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday",\
"saturday", or "sunday".  If you specify a day of the week\
by itself, the new date is either the next day of the week,\
or today if you specify the current day.\
\
You can use the parameters "next" and "last" along with the\
names of the days of the week. For example:\
\
    next monday\
    last tuesday\
\
You can also specify:\
\
    yesterday\
    today\
    tomorrow\
    now\
\
The "yesterday", "today", and "tomorrow" parameters set the\
current date but always specify the time of the file to be\
12:00 AM. The parameter "now" sets the date and time to the\
current date and time.\
\
If you specify an invalid date, you see this error\
message:\
\
    Invalid date string.  Press ANY KEY to continue\
\
If you cannot change the date of a file because you do not\
have permission to do so, you see this error message:\
\
    Can't change date. (Not owner) Press ANY KEY to continue\
\
Note:  You cannot set the date of any file or directory\
prior to January 1, 1970.  This is because of the internal\
method that the system uses to keep track of time.\
